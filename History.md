Oh Boy was a port of the [gnuboy](http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/) (version 1.0.3) Gameboy emulator for GP2 handhelds with a basic menu system by David Coldwell (ubyte.cwb). His website is no longer online. David created Oh Boy after frustrations with Lemonboy. I've exchanged emails with David and he is, "Glad to see OhBoy is living on".

Support was later added for:

  * Wiz
  * Caanoo

This repo was originally is based on the Oh Boy Caanoo Port Gameboy emulator made available by fishybawb in the posting http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?/topic/56595-ohboy-caanoo-port/. That version used gnuboy 1.0.3. This version uses the latest version of gnuboy.

For a related projects see the base [gnuboy](http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/) and also [Lemonboy](http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?/topic/48526-lemonboy-supercolor-gameboy-emu/) (has some Super Game Boy support).
